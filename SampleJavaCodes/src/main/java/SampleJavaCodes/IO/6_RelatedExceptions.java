/**
 * The IOException
 * 
 * The FileNotFoundException is thrown when the file or folder we seek
 * is not found. As we have already seen, FileNotFoundException is a 
 * subclass of IOException.
 * 
 * SecurityException is another exception that is thrown when dealing
 * with files, but only when a security manager is present.
