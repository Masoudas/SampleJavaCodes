/**
 * Thread.sleep causes the current thread to suspend execution for a specified
 * period. This is an efficient means of making processor time available to the
 * other threads of an application or other applications that might be running
 * on a computer system. The sleep method can also be used for pacing, as shown
 * in the example that follows, and waiting for another thread with duties that
 * are understood to have time requirements
