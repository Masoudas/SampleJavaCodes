/**
 * 
 * 
 * Each thread is associated with an instance of the class Thread. There are two
 * basic strategies for using Thread objects to create a concurrent application.
 * 
 *  1 - To directly control thread creation and management, simply instantiate Thread
 * each time the application needs to initiate an asynchronous task. 
 * 2- To abstract Thread management from the rest of your application, pass the application's
 * tasks to an executor.
 * 
 * Now as we know, and see in the examples in the outer folder, we can use either the Thread
 * or the Runnable interface to start a new thread.
