/** 
 * Genrics allow type check at compile time, because with old method of Objects,
 * we could only check cast at run-time. The compiler 
 * inserts casts for you automatically and tells you at compile time if you try to insert 
 * an object of the wrong type 
 * 
 * Generics are known as parametrized types. In other words, they let us treat the  
 * the types as parameters.  
 * 
 * Generic classes and interfaces are collectively known as generic types (something
 * that uses generics). 
 * 
 * Each generic type defines a set of parameterized types, using angle brackets, which consist of the 
 * class or interface name followed by an angle-bracketed list of actual type 
 * parameters corresponding to the generic typeâ€™s formal type parameters.
 * 
 * Finally, each generic type defines a raw type, which is the name of the generic 
 * type used without any accompanying type parameters
 * 
 * A class or interface whose declaration has one or more type parameters is a
 * generic class or interface 
 * 
 * Generics in Java and templates in C++ are totally different. For one thing, 
 * generics don't accept primitive types.
 * 
 * 
 * Note that generic type information is erased at runtime, it is only enforced at compile
 * time. This is why we call generics non-reifiable (less information about the variable
 * at runtime compared to compile type). The opposite are arrays, which are refiable!
