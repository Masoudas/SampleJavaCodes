/**
 *  POM: Project Object Model
 
 *  The POM file contains the basic informations and complining instructions for the file.
 *  For example, if we want to use maven project with java 9 or later, we need to change 
 *  the <version> field in the <maven-compiler-plugin>, and set the maven.compiler.release 
 *  property to the Java release you are targetting (e.g. 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.)
