/** 
 * See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html.
 * Careful use of concurrency is particularly important to the Swing programmer. 
 * A well-written Swing program uses concurrency to create a user interface that never "freezes" â€” 
 * the program is always responsive to user interaction, no matter what it's doing. 
 * To create a responsive program, the programmer must learn how the Swing framework employs threads.
 * A Swing programmer deals with the following kinds of threads:
 *     Initial threads: the threads that execute initial application code.
 *     !!!The event dispatch thread or EDT!!!: where all event-handling code is executed. 
 *     Most code that interacts with the Swing framework must also execute on this thread.
 *     Worker threads: also known as background threads, where time-consuming background tasks are executed.
 * The programmer does not need to provide code that explicitly creates these threads: 
 * they are provided by the runtime or the Swing framework. 
 * The programmer's job is to utilize these threads to create a responsive, maintainable Swing program. 
 * Like any other program running on the Java platform, a Swing program can create additional threads and thread pools, 
 * using the tools described in the Concurrency lesson. But for basic Swing programs the threads described here are sufficient.
