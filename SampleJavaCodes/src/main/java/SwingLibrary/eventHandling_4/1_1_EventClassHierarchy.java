/**
 * So if we look at 1_EventClassHierarchy.java, there are several functions of
 * interest in ActionEvent.
 * 
 * Example is getModifiers(), which indicates whether and which modifier key
 * (like alt, ctrl, etc) is pressed during the event.
 * 
 * paramString() indicates an string name indicating event name, used for debugging mostly.
 * 
 * getActionCommand() returns the name of the button.
 * setActionCommand() (re)sets the name
