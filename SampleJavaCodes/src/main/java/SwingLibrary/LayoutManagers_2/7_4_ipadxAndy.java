/**
 * They increase the internal preferred size of a component. By default, both
 * constraints are set to zero. The negative value for these constraints will
 * decrease the component’s preferred and minimum size. If you specify the value
 * for ipadx, the component’s preferred and minimum width will be increased by
 * 2*ipadx. Similarly, if you specify the value for ipady, the component’s
 * preferred and minimum height will be increased by 2*ipady. These options are
 * rarely used. The values for ipadx and ipady are specified in pixels.
