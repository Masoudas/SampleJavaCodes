/**
 * JPanel is a container, that can contain other components. Note however that
 * it's not a top level container, meaning you can't display it by itself. You
 * can set the color and other features of the container as well.
 * 
 * Sometimes, we put it in between some components to create a gap. It can also
 * be used to draw shapes. The default layout manager for a JPanel is
 * FlowLayout. Note that the default layout manager of the content pane of a
 * JFrame is a BorderLayout.
